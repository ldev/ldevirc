Hi,

Meet "ldevirc", the dysfunctional child of LDEV. At this stage this IRC bot is probably not insteresting for anyone else than me. Still not doing proper parsing of strings, so there are a bunch of possible exploits.

Features (as of now):
 * Auto OP (static predefined list)
 * Yell at people in Norwegian
 * Perform a traceroute and PRIVMSG it to the user requesting it. Hangs while doing the trace.
 
Requires:
 * Python 3.3+
 * Simplejson-package. (http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson - Check your Linux distro's package manager)
 
Installation procedure:
 * mkdir --parents ldevirc/{logs,auto-op}
 * cd ldevirc/
 * chmod +x development.py
 * mv config.json.sample config.json
 * Edit config.json to your liking (e.g. channel to join, nick..)
 * ./development.py
